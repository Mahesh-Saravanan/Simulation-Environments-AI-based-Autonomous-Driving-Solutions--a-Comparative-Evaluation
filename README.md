# Simulation-Environments-AI-based-Autonomous-Driving-Solutions--a-Comparative-Evaluation
This thesis presents a comprehensive approach to evaluate and enhance autonomous
vehicle simulators. The research comprises two primary works. Firstly, a systematic
evaluation methodology is introduced, establishing a scoring system based on 73 discerning
parameters to assist users in efficiently selecting a suitable simulator. This
method streamlines the process, enabling users to assess simulator capability aligned
with their specific needs.
Secondly, the thesis explores the development of a prototype simulator driven by a deep
generative model. This model aims to simulate the transition of 2D lidar data and
generate diverse scenarios crucial for training machine learning models in autonomous
driving.
The study assesses the performance of the system of comparison by evaluating existing
simulators and user preferences. Furthermore, the results of the proposed prototype
simulator are discussed.
